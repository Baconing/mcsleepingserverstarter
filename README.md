- Listen on the same port as your minecraft server.
  - Option to connect from BedRock *(Portable version of Minecraft)*
  - Web-gui, to turn on or off your server from anywhere

> Note: if you need to shutdown the program, simply input a `ctrl + c`, the program will shut down normally afterwards

-----
#### Announcing the server startup time (Linux server):
- To announce a time estimation to the user waking up the server you need to append ` && ./sleeping_wakeup_duration.sh` to the `minecraftCommand` option in the `sleepingSettings.yml`. Example: `minecraftCommand: "java -jar paper.jar nogui && ./sleeping_wakeup_duration.sh"`.

-----

#### Use WebServer for dynmap :
- You need to change your configuration from class: `org.dynmap.InternalClientUpdateComponent` to class `org.dynmap.JsonFileClientUpdateComponent` *(comment all the section InternalClientUpdateComponent and uncomment JsonFileClientUpdateComponent)*
- Chat will not work when hosted by mcsleepingserverstarter. For a full compatibilty, you can use an apache server *(https://github.com/webbukkit/dynmap/wiki/Setting-up-without-the-Internal-Web-Server)*

## üï∏ Bungeecord

While SleepingServerStarter is made to run on a single server, it can be integrated to a Bungeecord network. **But please note that you'll need to install and configure SleepingServerStarter on every servers you want to be affected by the program.**

Installing SleepingServerStarter only on your proxy server <u>**will NOT work**</u>

For each server you're installing SleepingServerStarter on :
- the `serverPort` should be the port of the server you're installing the program on, not the proxy's port
- make sure `serverOnlineMode` is set to `false` to avoid any problems with Bungee when switching between servers

We know this can be a little bit time consuming, but this solution is working great

#### In action :

When trying to join a sleeping server, you get this kind of message by Bungee<br/>
Basically, it keeps kicking the player with `loginMessage` as reason, telling the player the server is being started
